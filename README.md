# Project discontinued and not finished !

Working features:
- Employ someone near marker (probably works..).
- Collecting water(low, medium, high quality) and seeds(low, medium, high quality).
- Making coffee(low, medium, high quality) from water and seeds.
- Drinking coffee with animation.
- Replenishment needs when drinking coffee.
- Notification how good coffee will be(using mythic_notify from: https://github.com/wowpanda/mythic_notify, you have to add it on your own).
- Config file for blips+markers.

Not finished things:
- Fully working database with job/s and server.
- When first time drinking animation not works properly.
- Caffe interior (not included).
- Fire someone.

Todo things(yeah...):
- Ranks management.

To make it works do that steps:
- If you want to use not finished version just drop content of release folder to your server scripts folder and add it to server config.
- When you prefer to compile that script on your own, drop both folders(client, server) in one place then next open 'fivem_caffe_job.sln' in client folder (dont forget to replace 'CitizenFX.Core.dll' to yours server dll inside server-side script).

PS. Theres no thing like 'locate.en' every text was writted in PL so...
