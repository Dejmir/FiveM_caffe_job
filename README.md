# Project discontinued and not finished !

To make it works do that steps:
- If you want to use not finished version just drop content of release folder to your server scripts folder and add it to server config.
- When you prefer to compile that script on your own, drop both folders(client, server) in one place then next open 'fivem_caffe_job.sln' in client folder (dont forget to replace 'CitizenFX.Core.dll' to yours server dll inside server-side script).
